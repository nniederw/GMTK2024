The person who makes me, does not want me
The person who buys me, does not need me
And the person who needs me, does not know it
What am I? coffin

I am churches without gods,
Dry rivers, flat mountains
And lifeless cities.
What am I? map

In the morning I walk on four legs
During the day I walk on two
And in the evening I walk on three legs
What am I? human/Oedipus/man

Alive without breath,
As cold as death;
Never thirsty, ever drinking,
All in mail never clinking.
What am I? fish

I can run, but never walk
I have a mouth, but never talk
I have a head, but never weep
i have a bed, but never sleep
What am I? river

I can bring back the dead,
make you cry,make you laugh, make you young
I am born in an instant, yet last a lifetime.
What am I? memory

Rich people need me,
Poor people have me,
And if you eat me, you will die
What am I? nothing

I am tall when I am young,
yet when I am old, I grew shorter,
as my life burned away
What am I? candle

I am always running, but never move
I have no mouth, but a powerful roar
What am I? waterfall

I am as small as an ant, as big as a whale.
I am as slow as a snail, or as fast as lightning.
I will dance to the music, I can not hear.
What am I? shadow
